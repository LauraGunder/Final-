		<p>A contemporary ballet company co-founded in 2016 by artistic directors Amy Saunder, Jordan Miller and Tiffany Mangulabnan, three dancer-creators who hail from Zimbabwe, the US and the Philippines, and who come together (converge) in the name of creating art in New York City.</p>

	

		<h3>Their Story</h3>
		<p>We're a company of three women - dancer-creators, artists, and friends - who hail from separate parts of the globe and come together (converge) in the hope of creating something meaningful out of our passions, as so many dreaming people do in New York City.</p>

						

		<p>Our convergence, first as dancers, and ultimately as friends and co-creators; our mutual passion for live music; our commitment to thoughtful dancing and meaningful choreography; and the rare symbiosis and kinship among us, onstage as well as in life (a gift that we are continuously and happily discovering) - all this has laid the foundation for the building of konverjdans.</p>

		

		<p>But to say that we three alone embody the soul of this growing company is to grossly disregard the collaborative spirit behind everything we have done and yet hope to do. There is no work without our collaborations - without the musicians, filmmakers, photographers and other dancers and artists with whom we continue to form inspiring artistic relationships (friendships, really), and whose original work and talents to us are paramount and invaluable.</p>

		

		<p>While we will always have our classical ballet roots in the various companies we've danced with over the years (New York City Ballet, Suzanne Farrell Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet, BalletNext, Philippine Ballet Theatre, North Carolina Dance Theatre, Richmond Ballet, Eugene Ballet), we are also independent contemporary dancers: flinging ourselves into various projects (often concurrently and together) with other contemporary ballet choreographers in New York and elsewhere in the US, constantly needing to feed our mutual desires to absorb a diversity of artistic thoughts and ideas, and to challenge our minds and bodies.</p>

		


		<p>And in a way, konverjdans is just another venture we're throwing ourselves into for that very purpose: it's a safe space for us to test and hone our own abilities as choreographers and directors; to conduct open dialogues between artists of various fields, creating new work in dance, music and film all at once; and to create new and rich experiences we hope to share with diverse audiences, with our patrons, friends and collaborators, with our home countries, and with each other.</p>

		

		<p>We invite you to join the collaboration and follow our process on Patreon; check out our upcoming events, our past and current projects, our blog; and follow us along our journey on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/konverjdansFacebook" target="konverjdansFacebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/konverjdans/" target="Instagram">Instagram</a>!</p>




		<h3>Mission</h3> 

		<p>konverjdans is dedicated to celebrating the convergence of different art forms, backgrounds, and experiences by always creating dance in collaboration with other artists - musicians, visual artists, photographers, filmmakers, and others; to always performing with live music, highlighting the importance of musical collaboration in dance; and to performing in a wide variety of spaces, making dance accessible to diverse audiences. konverjdans hopes eventually to conduct outreach programs in the directors' home countries of the United States, Zimbabwe and the Philippines.</p>

		

		<p>konverjdans was a Selected Choreographer at the 2018 Women in Dance Leadership Conference in New York City, and has been presented several times by Norte Maar.</p>

		
		<p>We have presented our work at venues such as Danspace Project, Mark Morris Dance Center, Gibney Dance Center, The Actors Fund Arts Center, Socrates Sculpture Park, JOHN DOE Gallery,  The UNRULY Collective ArtHouse, The Muse Brooklyn, Lovecraft NYC, Bizarre Bushwick, The Paperbox NYC, and others.</p>
